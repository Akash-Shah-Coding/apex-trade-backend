# Trading App

![Mosaic TailwindCSS template preview](https://github.com/cruip/tailwind-dashboard-template/assets/2683512/ef306423-3b89-4d0c-be80-9c5c682478d1)

This repository contains a private trading application built using React, Node.js, Firebase, and Netlify. The project uses the **Mosaic Lite** dashboard template as a foundation, which is built on top of TailwindCSS and fully coded in React. This template includes several pre-coded charts (built with Chart.js 3) and widgets, making it an excellent starting point for creating a user interface for our trading app.

## Technologies Used

- **React** for building the user interface
- **Node.js** for the backend server
- **Firebase** for authentication and real-time database
- **Netlify** for deployment
